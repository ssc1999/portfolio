        <p>
          I'm a 25-year-old freelance software engineer from Spain based in the The Netherlands. I help companies ship clean, scalable, and fast products with modern web tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on backend and full stack development â€” mostly in APIs, DS & Algorithms and databases. I love working with several programming languages/frameworks and new AI tooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I enjoy skateboarding, traveling, photography, and experimenting with other projects.
